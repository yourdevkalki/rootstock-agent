# rootstock-agent
Project Idea: Open-Source DeFi Automation Platform (Rootstock)
Goal: Build a platform where anyone can create live automation agents (bots) for DeFi actions — like auto-compounding, limit orders, or recurring investments — on Rootstock.

Key Components
1. Task Registry (Smart Contract)
    * Stores tasks: target contract, function, condition (resolver), owner, and funds.
    * Allows users to create, cancel, and execute tasks.
2. Resolver (Condition Checker)
    * Logic that decides when a task should execute.
    * Can be simple (time interval) or price-based.
    * Can live on-chain (contract) or off-chain (Web3 Function).
3. Executor / Keeper (Off-chain Bot)
    * Watches tasks, checks resolvers.
    * Calls execute on the Task Registry when conditions are met.
    * Initially centralized for hackathon; can be decentralized later.
4. Front-end UI
    * Wallet connection (MetaMask, Rootstock-compatible).
    * Create automation tasks.
    * View task status and execution logs.
5. Funding / Fees
    * Users fund tasks (native token or ERC-20) to pay gas and executor.
    * Optional paymaster or sponsor for better UX.

MVP Scope for Hackathon
* 1 automation use-case:
    * Auto-compound LP rewards, price-triggered swap, or recurring DCA.
* Minimal smart contract + one resolver type.
* Single off-chain executor bot.
* Simple React dashboard to create/view tasks.
* Live demo: user creates task → executor triggers → result visible.

Pitch / Vision
“We are building the first open DeFi automation layer on Rootstock. Users can create live agents that handle repetitive DeFi tasks automatically. This unlocks passive, programmable finance for the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem while remaining open-source for developers to innovate on top.”

In short: It’s like Gelato, but open-source, early on Rootstock, and designed for any DeFi automation task.

If you want, I can also draw a simple diagram showing Task → Resolver → Executor → Execution — makes it super easy to explain to judges and teammates. Do you want me to do that?
